    <h1>🐴 Pixels, Prototypes &amp; a Little Bit of Horse Hair</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Olha — a UX/UI designer, frontend explorer, and someone who genuinely enjoys lining things up on a grid.</p>
    <p>
      I started designing professionally about <strong>15 years ago</strong>, shortly after graduating from university with a degree in Multimedia.
      I thought I’d end up in a studio sketching logos. Instead, I found myself solving real business problems with wireframes, colour palettes,
      and a borderline unhealthy obsession with button spacing.
    </p>
    <p>And here we are.</p>

    <h2>💻 What I Actually Do</h2>
    <p>
      I help founders, startups, and teams design digital products that look great and make sense.
      My sweet spot is where <strong>clean design meets conversion</strong> — and users don't even notice, because it just works.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>🧭 Interfaces that guide users without shouting</li>
      <li>💸 Landing pages that convert better (and look better doing it)</li>
      <li>🛠 Prototypes that help teams move faster</li>
      <li>🧩 Design systems that bring order to design chaos</li>
      <li>📱 Apps and flows that feel effortless to use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💼 Experience in 3 Bullet Points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🎓 Master’s degree in Multimedia Design</li>
      <li>🧪 Certified in UX Foundations (Coursera, 2023)</li>
      <li>⭐ Top Rated Plus on Upwork with 70+ successful projects and a 100% Job Success score</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’ve worked with companies in SaaS, eCommerce, education, healthcare, real estate, beauty, and more.</p>

    <h2>🛠 Tools I Trust</h2>
    <p>
      Figma · Sketch · Adobe Suite · Zeplin · Axure · Unbounce · InVision
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t believe the tool makes the designer, but I do believe Ctrl+Z has saved lives.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>🐎 Outside the Design World...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I’m probably riding horses (yes, really — mane and all)</li>
      <li>Travelling and “accidentally” reviewing UX flows in hotel booking forms</li>
      <li>Shooting underwater photos (I even won an award once!)</li>
      <li>Or just enjoying a moment of whitespace — offline</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fun fuels creativity. And I like to keep both in good supply.</p>

    <h2>✨ Why I Built This Site</h2>
    <p>
      This is my corner of the internet — part blog, part portfolio, part design diary.
    </p>
    <p>I share:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple tips for UX/UI and frontend</li>
      <li>Ideas for better conversion and layout logic</li>
      <li>Real thoughts from real projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Nothing overpolished. Just honest insights and useful things from someone who still thinks design is a bit magical.
