      <h1>👋 Hey, I’m Olha</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my personal site!</p>
      <p>
        I’ve spent 15 years in the web world — designing, coding, and building
        pages that work. This is where I share what I’ve learned (and what I’m
        still figuring out).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you care about creating websites that look great and work
        well — you’re in the right place.

        <h2>🎯 Why I Started This</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted a space to share
          <strong>practical things that actually help</strong> — not long-winded
          think pieces or recycled trends. Just short, valuable ideas you can
          use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’re a designer, small business owner, or just someone who
          builds things online — I hope this blog gives you something useful or
          inspiring.
