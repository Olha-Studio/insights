> Summary: A conversion-focused UX overhaul of a SaaS onboarding flow. We simplified the first steps, clarified value, and instrumented events to learn fast. Outcome: +27% signup conversion, -18% drop‑off at Step 1.

## Client & Context
- Industry: B2B SaaS (project source: Upwork)
- Product: Web app with free trial and paid tiers
- Funnel: Marketing site → Signup → In‑app onboarding (3 steps)

## Goals
1. Increase trial‑to‑signup conversion on desktop and mobile
2. Reduce early step drop‑offs (esp. Step 1 email, Step 2 profile)
3. Clarify value and expected time to complete

## Audience & Constraints
- Primary audience: non‑technical SMB owners
- Constraints: keep existing backend + analytics; 6‑week window

## Hypotheses
- H1: Showing time‑to‑complete and progress reduces anxiety and abandonment
- H2: Inline validation + fewer fields increases form completion
- H3: A “guided choice” preset improves decision speed on plan selection

## Solution Overview
- Introduced a 3‑step progressive onboarding with clear progress and ETA
  - Step 1: account basics (email + password + SSO options)
  - Step 2: guided preset (use case cards) → prefilled defaults
  - Step 3: success screen with primary “start” action
- Reduced total inputs from 14 to 6; added inline validation and password strength meter
- Rewrote microcopy: action‑first, benefit‑led, plain language
- Added metrics (events + properties) to every decision point

## UX/Design Flow
1. Entry: signup page carries headline, value bullets, trust icons
2. Step 1: single column form, SSO first, email keyboard on mobile
3. Step 2: use‑case presets with visual cards, default configs applied
4. Step 3: success with primary CTA and secondary explore link
5. Empty states improved with quick tips and links to help

## Implementation Notes
- Frontend: semantic HTML, accessible labels, clear focus states
- Performance: image dimensions, async assets, no layout shifts
- Tracking: events for view/submit/error/abandon at each step
- A/B: variant for microcopy on Step 2; shipped to 50% of traffic

## Results (4 weeks post‑launch)
- +27% overall signup conversion (stat‑sig, p<0.05)
- -18% drop‑off at Step 1; -12% at Step 2
- +16% completion on mobile (largest gains from keyboard + SSO)

## What Mattered Most
- Fewer fields and clearer defaults
- Progress + ETA header decreased perceived effort
- Helpful microcopy reduced form stalls and backtracks

## Screens & Artifacts
- Wireframes, annotated flows, and copy deck (available on request)
