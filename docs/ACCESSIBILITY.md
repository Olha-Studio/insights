Manual prompt snippet

"""
You are my coding copilot. Task: [accessibility improvement].
Before acting, load and follow docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md for a11y rules (alt text, contrast, focus, semantics) used here.
"""

Guidelines
- Text alternatives: meaningful `alt` (avoid redundancy).
- Headings: single h1 per page, logical order.
- Contrast: ensure hover/active states keep AA.
- Focus: visible focus rings on interactive elements.
- Landmarks: header, main, footer.
